Nice diagram showcasing the differences between Collection and Non-Collection 
NFTS. 

Absolutely Key Notes: 

1. The Verified boolean represents if the NFT is a part of the collection.
Without this, any user could pretend their NFT is in the collection and 
thus forge sniper rifles. 

2. On the application, we MUST check this field to be true every time 
the user selects a weapon in their arsenal. 

3. Utilize the Verify instruction to flip the Token's verified field
from false to true. On initialization, we'll default to always False.
Fun Fact: Metaplex uses proof by signature of collection authority 
to cryptographically prove this NFT belongs to the collection.

4/23 Began Implementing Multiplayer Functionality on the Game Itself.
Let's understand the architecture a bit, because it is kind of confusing.

src/pages/api/socket.ts: Backend 
- Runs a NextJS API Route to prevent dependency conflicts with NodeJS
- Starts a Socket.io server on first request
- When 2 people connect, a random seed is generated and "hello world" commences.
- messages relayed
- <SocketInit />
